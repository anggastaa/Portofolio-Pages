## Project 1: Pizzeria store
This project involved designing and building a relational database system tailored specifically for a new pizzeria business, similar to Domino's. The focus was on designing a comprehensive relational database and performing in-depth data analysis. This data would then be used to monitor business performance through custom-built dashboards. The primary goal was to provide the pizzeria owner with a solid foundation for efficient operations and data-driven decision-making.

### Project Brief
The project aims to develop a comprehensive system for managing pizzeria operations. It will track various aspects of the business, including order activity, stock levels, and staff information. Key features will include the ability to view detailed order information, analyze stock levels and costs, and monitor staff performance. This system will provide valuable insights for optimizing operations and making data-driven decisions.

## Project Goals
To develop a robust pizzeria management system that empowers the owner with a comprehensive dashboard, providing real-time insights into order activity, stock levels, and staff performance. This dashboard will facilitate data-driven decision-making and optimize overall pizzeria operations.
